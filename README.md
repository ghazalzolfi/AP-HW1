Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Git - Exercise 1

This exercise focuses on two key areas: mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python and learning **Git** for version control. The main objectives are:

1. Class Diagram and OOP Concepts:
   - Design a class diagram for a chosen real-world problem (e.g., animals, geometric shapes, real estate, or vehicles).
   - Implement the diagram using Python, ensuring to apply OOP principles such as:
     - Encapsulation
     - Inheritance
     - Abstraction
     - Polymorphism
     - Composition
     - Aggregation

2. Working with Git:
   - Create a Git repository and structure the project using branches.
   - Commit meaningful changes for the class diagram and code implementation.
   - Merge the branches while retaining the original ones.

   
This exercise emphasizes practical implementation of OOP concepts in Python, alongside efficient Git usage for collaborative coding and version control.
